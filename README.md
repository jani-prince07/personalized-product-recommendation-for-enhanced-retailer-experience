Personalized Product Recommendations for Enhanced Retailer Experience
1. Problem Statement Chosen:
Retailers on Qwipo’s B2B marketplace struggle with poor product discovery, repetitive purchasing patterns, stagnant order values, and low customer retention. Over 60% of relevant products go unnoticed, and around 35% of retailers become inactive within six months due to poor shopping experience. This results in missed cross-selling and upselling opportunities, plateaued revenue growth, and increased churn. An intelligent, scalable recommendation system is required to address these issues and enhance retailer experience.

2. Detailed Proposal and Prototype Plan
Our proposal is to design a hybrid product recommendation system that leverages user behavior, purchase history, and product metadata to deliver personalized suggestions in real time. The system will:
a) Provide cross-sell and upsell recommendations to increase Average Order Value (AOV) by 15–25%.
b)Improve repeat purchases by 20–30% with timely reorder prompts.
c) churn by delivering relevant product discovery experiences.

Prototype Plan (Phases):
a) Data Audit & Preparation: Collect browsing, search, and purchase data, curate product metadata.
b) Model Development: Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models with ranking algorithms.
c) Integration: Expose APIs for real-time recommendations with <200ms response.
d) Pilot Testing: A/B testing with a subset of retailers to measure CTR, AOV, an4 retention.
e) Scaling: Expand to all users with supply-aware, mobile-first deployment.

3. Features to Be Implemented
a) User Behavior Analytics: Capture and analyze browsing, clicks, searches, and purchases.
b) Purchase Pattern Recognition: Detect reorder cycles, seasonal demand, and complementary items.
c) Personalization Engine: Generate tailored product lists using collaborative + content-based filtering.
d) Supply-Aware Recommendations: Filter out unavailable or low-priority SKUs.
e) Mobile Integration: Seamless API integration with Qwipo’s mobile app for real-time personalization.

4. Tech Stack Used
a) Web & API Development: Node.js with Express / FastAPI, REST/GraphQL APIs, WebSockets for real-time.
b) Database & Storage: PostgreSQL / MongoDB for product & order data, Redis for caching.
c) AI/ML Frameworks: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model training and ranking.
d) Infrastructure: Microservices architecture, Docker/Kubernetes for deployment, Kafka for event streaming.
e) Performance Goals: 99.9% uptime, sub-200ms API latency, support for 10,000+ retailer profiles concurrently.
